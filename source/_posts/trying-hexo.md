So... my old blog is down because it was hosted on the servers of my old job ðŸ™Š and since that company does not exists anymore and you can guess what happen to my blog.
Anyway I found my self in the situation I need a new blog! Yes! A new oportunity to build a blog engine...
No way, I do not have the time, the energy and many more things you need to build something like that.

Since I am a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) fan and I love their documentation, I decide give [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) a chance.

Well hexo seems pretty cool and easy to implement and the best part is that it will generate all the static files you need, so you can grab the public folder, throw it to netlify and BOOM!
You are ready to share your thoughs with the whole world.

### Installing Hexo

The very first thing you will need to work with Hexo is - yeah you probably guess - install it!

```bash
npm i hexo-cli -g
```

Like I said at the beginning of this post, you will need Node and npm installed in your machine.
What? Ok probbably I forgot to tell you! I am under a lot of pressure here, first entry of my blog ok?

Once the installation is ready you can create a new hexo project using the **new** option.

### Creating a Hexo Site

```bash
hexo new "blog"
```

Yes! I call my new project blog! Do not judge me! Once the new command has finish doing their magic it will generate a new blog folder and inside it a lot of files and folders.

### Configuration

From this point looks like you can change the configuration of your hexo site in the **config.yml**
file.
![hexo config](https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog/trying-hexo/hexo-config.png)

I did a few changes, like the title, subtitle, description and timezone. Yes I am from PerÃº ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª

### Where in the hell I can see the site?

Yeah right? All the instalation and configuration for nothing! What a waste of... Oh wait!
Yes, there is a **server** command which hexo use to start a local server.

```bash
hexo server
```

If you go to your favorite browser and write the http://localhost:4000 url you will see the site.

### Theme

The default theme is...well not just for me. So I go to https://hexo.io/themes/ and I was looking
for a new theme. Cactus! It is the name of the theme I like. Looks like it is free so why not?
This is the [repo on github](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus).
In the repo I can see the following folders: languages, layout, scripts, source and other files and in my **blog** folder generated by Hexo I have the same structure of folders under the theme/landscape folder.
Sometimes I can be really smart so I clone the repo inside the theme folder and run the **server** command again.

Before it starts the local server again I realize it was dumb to expect hexo guess I want a new theme turns out I am not so smart - at least not like I though - My first reaction was to open the **\_config.yml** again,press cmd+f and put the theme word on it. I am smart again! I found the property theme with the landscape value which I replaced for cactus. Ok the server command should work now.

Jeez, everything is broken now.

### Generate static files

The **generate** command will create all the javascript, css and html according the new theme.

```bash
hexo generate
```

Ok, time to lunch the local server again using the **server** command and everything looks good.

### Writing posts

Since the whole point of playing with hexo was having a blog I can now start writing posts. So easy I only have to add a new markdown file into the **souce/\_post** folder and that's it.

I am pretty happy with hexo so far, do not be like me and read the [documentation](https://hexo.io/docs) if you have any doubts.
